    "Message system during events is making a multiple-database-call request and re-rendering a view *that isn't even visible* most of the time, every fifteen seconds *on the quarter* for *every single participant*. Counts out at 35ms view, 1-2ms database for each request. Currently not exactly a problem, but not fantastically scaleable. we should use something memory-based, either a messaging service (Kafka?), a single-render multiple-push backend with websockets, or even just a fourteen-second cache of the data and rendered partial!\n",
