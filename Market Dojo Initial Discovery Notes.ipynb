    "# Initial thoughts (2016-09-13)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large codebase, nicely laid out. Lots of tests, which appear themselves to be well-written. Use of Rubocop, RSpec and Reek seen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Short on comments. Some use of TODO, a couple of HACKs, almost no NOTEs. No comment attributions **or dating** even for TODOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Users model is possibly the largest Ruby file I've ever seen. That could really do with breaking up if possible, it's a ridiculous size for what appears to be one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good use of Git & GitHub, in particular code reviews/pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "There appears to be a bug tracking system, but it's NOT the GitHub Issues system. Might need to find out why, given it's the primary collaboration platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company seems to make a lot of use of Skype. Best see if I can move them to Slack, for better multi-channel comms and collab tools, chat histories, bot-compatibility and so on. Hopefully will never be required to do voice or video chat; not stated either way but somewhat implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    " - Test cases which rely on Time.now fail between 2300 and (some time after 00:45 but before 09:50) GMT. Before midnight is not the same as after midnight.\n",
    "  - Yes, seriously. \n",
    "  - No, I have no idea how that works either, yet.\n",
    "  - Issue appears to be an off-by-one error (in some cases); before midnight the result is `-1` from expectation, after midnight it is `+1`. \n",
    "  - Replicated three nights running.\n",
    "  - All tests work fine at 10:33 and 13:32.\n",
    "  - RSpec takes 7:30 to run, roughly; consider making a script to run it once every ten minutes for 24 hours and plot the number of failures?\n",
