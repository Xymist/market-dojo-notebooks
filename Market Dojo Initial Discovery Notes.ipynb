    "# Initial thoughts (2016-09-13)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large codebase, nicely laid out. Lots of tests, which appear themselves to be well-written. Use of Rubocop, RSpec and Reek seen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Short on comments. Some use of TODO, a couple of HACKs, almost no NOTEs. No comment attributions **or dating** even for TODOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Users model is possibly the largest Ruby file I've ever seen. That could really do with breaking up if possible, it's a ridiculous size for what appears to be one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good use of Git & GitHub, in particular code reviews/pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "There appears to be a bug tracking system, but it's NOT the GitHub Issues system. Might need to find out why, given it's the primary collaboration platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company seems to make a lot of use of Skype. Best see if I can move them to Slack, for better multi-channel comms and collab tools, chat histories, bot-compatibility and so on. Hopefully will never be required to do voice or video chat; not stated either way but somewhat implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    " - Test cases which rely on Time.now fail between 2300 and (some time after 00:45 but before 09:50) GMT. Before midnight is not the same as after midnight.\n",
    "  - Yes, seriously. \n",
    "  - No, I have no idea how that works either, yet.\n",
    "  - Issue appears to be an off-by-one error (in some cases); before midnight the result is `-1` from expectation, after midnight it is `+1`. \n",
    "  - Replicated three nights running.\n",
    "  - All tests work fine at 10:33 and 13:32.\n",
    "  - RSpec takes 7:30 to run, roughly; consider making a script to run it once every ten minutes for 24 hours and plot the number of failures?\n",

    " \n",
    "Update Gem dependencies to R4.0 compatible versions\n",
    "\n",
    " - Will have to check these individually for compatibility\n",
    " - Generate new Rails 4.0 project and use that Gemfile plus all additional dependencies?\n",
    " - Replace deprecated, unused or unmaintained gems where at all possible\n",
    "  - How deeply embedded is Comatose? That in particular could be an enormous task, especially with all the tests to rewrite.\n",
    "   - Write own CMS?\n",
    "   - Update Comatose to be a Rails 4.0 gem?\n",
    "   - Find new recommended R4.0 compatible CMS?\n",
    "  - Replace Squeel with BabySqueel\n",
    "   - Unsure how much this will break; best to check.\n",
    " \n",
    "Fix all the test failures this will cause\n",
    " - 99%+ test coverage should make this relatively straightforward to check, although with the number of methods to check it will be quite time consuming.\n",
    " \n",
    "Repeat with Rails 4.1 and 4.2\n",
    " - These will both work with current Ruby version\n",
    " - Recognised upgrade paths\n",
    " - Most 4.0 gems will work up to 4.2 without significant modification\n",
    " - Ensures all the tests are up to scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate position. Rails 5 has a lot of major breaking changes, and will also require moving to (at minimum) Ruby 2.2.2 and more probably Ruby 2.3.1 for forward compatibility:\n",
    " - Another round of Gem updating/upgrading/replacing\n",
    " - Rewriting a *lot* of the existing tests\n",
    " - Updating Rubocop, Parser and Reek to the latest versions and running them again\n",
    "  - These will undoubtedly report a constellation of new and different errors due to the changes in syntax and method names that Ruby has undergone in the last few years.\n",
