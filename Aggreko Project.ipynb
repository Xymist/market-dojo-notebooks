    "\n",
    "**Logins/impersonation**\n",
    " - Log in as self\n",
    " - Dashboard\n",
    " - Users - search\n",
    " - More actions\n",
    " - Impersonate (Chad Th... is a good example)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Lots**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ~~Line item name 30 chars only?~~\n",
    "  - Dropdown pick options\n",
    "  - ~~Decimal and integer options~~\n",
    "  - Better way of displaying the 'table' for line items which doesn't lead to excessive scrolling\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Approach**\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - Existing fields are a float field and a text field in the DB\n",
    "    - map to a decimal type and a string type in the app\n",
    "   - Will need one more for each new field type\n",
    "    - PickList_ID\n",
    "     - Therefore maybe new relation - Field has_one PickList?\n",
    "    - Number\n",
    "    - DateTime (use class 'hasDatePicker')\n",
    "   - Desired new fields are *Date*, *Dropdown* and *Number*.\n",
    "   - Serverside validation before INSERT\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Date field should be a calendar select. \n",
    "    - Guarantees a correct date entry\n",
    "    - More efficient than a picklist, especially for same-month choices\n",
    "    - Can be done with jQuery UI, which is already included\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Dropdowns are a touch more complex\n",
    "    - Host needs to be able to create new dropdowns or select from old ones\n",
    "     - Means they need to be stored after use\n",
    "     - Means database storage:\n",
    "      - User has many PickLists\n",
    "      - PickList has many PickListOptions\n",
    "       - PickList: ID - int, Name - string, User_ID - int\n",
    "      - PickList belongs_to User\n",
    "      - PickListOption belongs_to PickList\n",
    "       - PickListOption: ID - int, Value - string, PickList_ID - int\n",
    "     - Have the Host's entries add to an array in creation (for speed), write to DB as with a .each approach?\n",
    "      - Modal popup on 'create picklist'\n",
    "       - \"Type or paste into this box, separated by commas\"\n",
    "       - Parse contents of box accordingly\n",
    "       \n",
    "   - \"Do you really want to delete this because it may affect calculations\" should only appear for fields which affect calculations.\n",
