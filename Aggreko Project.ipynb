    "\n",
    "**Logins/impersonation**\n",
    " - Log in as self\n",
    " - Dashboard\n",
    " - Users - search\n",
    " - More actions\n",
    " - Impersonate (Chad Th... is a good example)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Lots**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ~~Line item name 30 chars only?~~\n",
    "  - Dropdown pick options\n",
    "  - ~~Decimal and integer options~~\n",
    "  - Better way of displaying the 'table' for line items which doesn't lead to excessive scrolling\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Approach**\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - Existing fields are a float field and a text field in the DB\n",
    "    - map to a decimal type and a string type in the app\n",
    "   - Will need one more for each new field type\n",
    "    - PickList_ID\n",
    "     - Therefore maybe new relation - Field has_one PickList?\n",
    "    - Number\n",
    "    - DateTime (use class 'hasDatePicker')\n",
    "   - Desired new fields are *Date*, *Dropdown* and *Number*.\n",
    "   - Serverside validation before INSERT\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Date field should be a calendar select. \n",
    "    - Guarantees a correct date entry\n",
    "    - More efficient than a picklist, especially for same-month choices\n",
    "    - Can be done with jQuery UI, which is already included\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Dropdowns are a touch more complex\n",
    "    - Host needs to be able to create new dropdowns or select from old ones\n",
    "     - Means they need to be stored after use\n",
    "     - Means database storage:\n",
    "      - User has many PickLists\n",
    "      - PickList has many PickListOptions\n",
    "       - PickList: ID - int, Name - string, User_ID - int\n",
    "      - PickList belongs_to User\n",
    "      - PickListOption belongs_to PickList\n",
    "       - PickListOption: ID - int, Value - string, PickList_ID - int\n",
    "     - Have the Host's entries add to an array in creation (for speed), write to DB as with a .each approach?\n",
    "      - Modal popup on 'create picklist'\n",
    "       - \"Type or paste into this box, separated by commas\"\n",
    "       - Parse contents of box accordingly\n",
    "       \n",
    "   - \"Do you really want to delete this because it may affect calculations\" should only appear for fields which affect calculations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "**Award Lots**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Requires custom reports\n",
    " - **User Story stage 1:** \n",
    "  - 1) Add an 'Include in Award Notice' column with an info-help icon\n",
    "  - 2) It defaults to green tick = Yes when an 'Awarded Participant' is selected from the drop-down\n",
    "  - 3) User can toggle to red cross = No\n",
    "  - 4) No tick or cross option if 'None' is selected in 'Awarded Participant' column\n",
    "  - 5) Soft blue banner text at the top needs to change to, \"Use this pop-up to record how you intend to award the Lots to your participants.  You can also notify them via the tool by choosing who to notify and creating a new award notice to send them.  You can do this in stages if you wish to bespoke each notification.\"\n",
    "  - 6) A new button called 'Create New Award Notice' is added in that adds more options to the bottom of the pop-up (see 'adding scorers' pop-up for a working example)\n",
    "  - 7) Clicking 'Create New Award Notice' shows error message if no Lot has been toggled to 'Include in Award Notice', \"You have not selected any Lots to include in this notice.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    " - **User Story stage 2:**\n",
    "  - 1) Clicking the 'Create New Award Notice' button makes extra fields reveal, much like we do on 'Add New Scorer' pop-up.\n",
    "  - 2) A text field to enter a Purchase Order Number.  If used, it includes the number in the Event Report (excel) and also in the Award Notice Email, just as an extra row of text.\n",
    "  - 3) An expandable text field to edit the notification email text, with a confirmation of that text to the right to show what you're writing.  Please consult 'Approve Decision' pop-up in SIM for an example.\n",
    "  - 4) Click 'Send Award Notice' to send out the email to the Awarded Participants.  Send 1 email to each Participant, listing out the Lots that participant has been awarded.  The email will contain a Bid Report for the Participant detailing the Lots that they have been awarded (see other user story).\n",
    "  - 5) Once sent, hide all the New Award Notice details to return to the pop-up as it was, though with new details; See below.\n",
    "  - 6) Show a confirmation message saying \"The Award Notice has been sent.  Your Award details have been updated to confirm this.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    " - **User Story stage 3:**\n",
    "  - 1) It marks which Lot has been notified using a small green tick and the text 'Notified', using the same style we see on 'Status' column on an event Participant tab.\n",
    "  - 2) It also adds a comment icon next to it so you can see the notification text that went with this.  \n",
    "  - 3) Clicking the comment box will bring up a pop-up/info box of when the notification was made, what message was used and what PO was entered.\n",
    "  - 4) Further notifications can be made after this, but only to Lots that haven't been notified already.\n",
    "  - 5) Lots that have been notified will not receive further notification messages and will be locked down.  The Participant drop-down will be greyed out.\n",
    "  - 6) The Host 'Download Event Report' excel report will contain the information in the 'Award Lots' tab.  Please see the top of this page for details.\n",
