    "# Rails Upgrade Path\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thoroughly Rubocop, as far as possible, to minimise impact of deprecated syntax on upgrades\n",
    " - Autocorrect has already been done, ready for merging. Remainder is manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thoroughly Reek, as far as possible, to minimise amount of code needed to port.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove Comatose (Not forward compatible)\n",
    " - Replace 404 page\n",
    " - Replace 'thank you for signing up' page\n",
    "\n",
    "- for each gem in Gemfile\n",
    " - establish what function it provides\n",
    " - comment function and importance next to gem declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through deprecation logs, especially those generated by Rspec.\n",
    " - Establish which errors belong to external gems\n",
    " - for each gem generating deprecation errors\n",
    "  - if it has an available update\n",
    "   - if that updated version is compatible with Rails 3.2\n",
    "    - update\n",
    "   - else\n",
    "    - flag as 'Updateable' with comment in Gemfile\n",
    "   - end\n",
    "  - else\n",
    "   - if the function is not in rails && the function is still necessary\n",
    "    - find alternative gem\n",
    "   - else\n",
    "    - remove gem, patch dependency hole\n",

    "Move to Rails 4.0 from v3.2.22.3\n",
    "\n",
    " - Next significant version of Rails\n",
    " - Compatible with current (2.1.1) version of Ruby\n",
    " - Recommended upgrade path exists\n",
    " \n",
    "Update Gem dependencies to R4.0 compatible versions\n",
    "\n",
    " - Will have to check these individually for compatibility\n",
    "  - Ought to document what each of the gems is for beforehand. If they're UI gems, check if they're even necessary after iKantam's updates!\n",
    " - Replace deprecated, unused or unmaintained gems where at all possible\n",
    "  - ~~How deeply embedded is Comatose? That in particular could be an enormous task, especially with all the tests to rewrite.\n",
    "   - Write own CMS?\n",
    "   - Update Comatose to be a Rails 4.0 gem?\n",
    "   - Find new recommended R4.0 compatible CMS?~~\n",
    "  - Replace Squeel with BabySqueel for performance and support\n",
    "   - Unsure how much this will break; best to check.\n",
    " \n",
    "Fix all the test failures this will cause\n",
    " - With the number of methods to check, this will be quite time consuming.\n",
    " \n",
    "Repeat with Rails 4.1 and 4.2\n",
    " - These will both work with current Ruby version\n",
    " - Recognised upgrade paths\n",
    " - Most 4.0 gems will work up to 4.2 without significant modification\n",
    " - Ensures all the tests are up to scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate position. Rails 5 has a lot of major breaking changes, and will also require moving to (at minimum) Ruby 2.2.2 and more probably Ruby 2.3.1 for forward compatibility:\n",
    " - Another round of Gem updating/upgrading/replacing\n",
    " - Rewriting a *lot* of the existing tests\n",
    " - Updating Rubocop, Parser and Reek to the latest versions and running them again\n",
    "  - These will undoubtedly report a constellation of new and different errors due to the changes in syntax and method names that Ruby has undergone in the last few years."
