    "We're gathering quite a lot of data about how people bid, the end values of lots given the qualification price, average bid rate, optimum lot length and various other metrics, purely by virtue of retaining all the events in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think there's an opportunity here to give advice to the Hosts about how they should structure their auctions given their requirements. Exactly how we go about that is a question of its own, but given some specific questions (\"what lot length results in the most bids without long waits at the beginning or end, and without cutting off a good competition?\" would be a naive example) we could train a TensorFlow neural net on the data we already have and see if it produces good predictions which we could then feed back to the Hosts and help them design their lots better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "It would seem reasonable that, given we already provide document uploading capabilities, we could wire the document retrieval to the Google Natural Language API. That would allow all participants and hosts to submit and retrieve documents in their own language, without worrying about to whom they will be sent or in what language they were originally. For companies like Aggreko, who could have someone speaking one language submitting jobs to be bid for in countries where the official language is something different, this would be a significant reduction in friction. Currently the most 'production ready' languages are English and Spanish, which would be somewhat useful in Europe and moreso in the Americas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vein we should encourage the people who spend most time on support (Lewis, Pete, Craig) to use the web interface for support, as Zoho provide a realtime translation service. It looks good to look multinational and talk to people in their own languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Scaleability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon provide both database instances (RDS) and compute (EC2), plus storage (S3). Conveniently packaged as Elastic Beanstalk this provides us somewhere to put the app which will autoscale (to a point). As a place to move away from Liberata this offers significant potential."
